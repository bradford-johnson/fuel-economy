## Project Summary 🗒️
### `🧭- Project scenario`
```
- Provide data-backed analysis and recommendations around vehicle fuel economy
- Client is interested in vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specs
- They want to understand how those might drive fuel economy and annual fuel costs
```
| **Project Objective** |
|---|
| Identify and conduct statistical tests on factors that drive fuel economy and annual costs |

### `🔧- Methods`

| Research Questions                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Does the Start / Stop Technology make a significant difference in fuel costs / consumption?         |
| Does the car’s “age” or model year have a significant difference in fuel economy?                   |
| How significant is the car’s class (car type: minivan, truck, compact…) in the consumption of fuel? |
```
Most vehicles use regular gas as a fuel type -> focus on regular gas vehicles
  - Regular gas is convenient, and already has nationwide infrastructure

Subcompact and compact vehicles are the most common classes -> focus on these car classes
  - These two classes are the most popular and they are quite similar in specific metrics

Car "age" determined by the model year -> focus on new vs used
